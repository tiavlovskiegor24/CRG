Managing my work at CRG 


* Diary
** TODO Create a daily log here 


* BHIVE

** Analysis
*** [#A] HIV expression prediciton
**** TODO Run SVMs
**** TODO Run RF
**** TODO Run gradient boosting



** Machine Learning Pipeline
*** DONE Create SVM pipeline function 
*** DONE Test SVM pipeline function
    SCHEDULED: <2017-03-07 Tue>
    Seems to be working
*** TODO Consider moving the scalling of features to the dataset preprocessing stage 


** Dataset processing
*** DONE drop features
*** DONE Split into train and test and save to files
*** DONE count number of samples with NaNs
    Number of samples with Nan is 433
    For now I simply deleted those samples

**** DONE remove Nans from the data set and train on those 
**** TODO Think through more discreet handling of samples with Nans
     for example leave those samples which have Nan for distance features

*** DONE [#C] create ML_inputs namedtuple rather then dictionary
*** DONE [#A] extract and store indices of different features types in ML_inputs tuple
*** DONE [#A] apply log1p to the distance values
*** TODO [#A] Only leave '_r' scores, drop the rest

** Feature File processing
*** DONE Finish up feature file to full array routine
*** DONE finish off write feature file


** Hi-C matrix features
*** DONE fix GMFPT feature writing to file
*** DONE check row sum feature writting to file
*** DONE check decay constant writting to file
*** DONE compute gmfpt for

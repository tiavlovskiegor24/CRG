**** TODO Only leave '_r' scores, drop the rest      :BHIVE:DS_processing:
**** TODO Moving the scalling of features to the DS preprocessing stage :BHIVE:DS_processing:ML_inputs:
move the issue to the feature_type processing [[file:feature_types.py][rules]] 
**** TODO Think through more discreet handling of samples with Nans :BHIVE:DS_processing:
for example leave those samples which have Nan for distance features
move the issue to the feature_type processing [[file:feature_types.py][rules]] 
**** TODO Create Adaboost pipeline                     :BHIVE:ML_pipeline:
**** TODO Add gradient boosting to ML_pipeline

* BHIVE (archive)

** Analysis
*** HIV expression prediciton
**** TODO Run SVMs
**** TODO Run RF
**** TODO Run AdaBoost
**** TODO Run gradient boosting



** Machine Learning Pipeline
*** DONE Create SVM pipeline function 
*** DONE Test SVM pipeline function
    SCHEDULED: <2017-03-07 Tue>
    Seems to be working


** Dataset processing
*** DONE drop features
*** DONE Split into train and test and save to files
*** DONE count number of samples with NaNs
    Number of samples with Nan is 433
    For now I simply deleted those samples

**** DONE remove Nans from the data set and train on those 

*** DONE [#C] create ML_inputs namedtuple rather then dictionary
*** DONE [#A] extract and store indices of different features types in ML_inputs tuple
*** DONE [#A] apply log1p to the distance values



** Feature File processing
*** DONE Finish up feature file to full array routine
*** DONE finish off write feature file


** Hi-C matrix features
*** DONE fix GMFPT feature writing to file
*** DONE check row sum feature writting to file
*** DONE check decay constant writting to file
*** DONE compute gmfpt
